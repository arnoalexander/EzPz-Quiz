        But, his celebration didn\'t last long. He realized that his ship and all the crew are
        suddenly disappeared (it\'s normal here) right after he took a shot of tequila while sitting on
        white soft Caribbean beach sand. Surprisingly, he was not surprised. Apparently, his mind

        in that island. Each chest can only be discovered at most once. Otherwise, it might disappear

        possible before sunset. What\'s the name of this problem?</string>
